# Jitsi Videobridge Zabbix Stats
An simple implementation of Jitsi Videobridge Statistics, to Zabbix. 

Jitsi Videobridge Stats. Based on Colibri stats built-in api to present Statistics from Jitsi Videobridge. I've added the most important data, some stats were not added, but it is easy to add them by using the Zabbix Server GUI. 

If you haven't enabled Videobridge statistics, see Jitsi documentation below.

### Full Documentation of Jitsi Videobridge Colibri Stats

`https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/blob/master/doc/rest.md`


The only thing that you must do is from Zabbix site:

Add the XML template through Zabbix GUI.

### Macros

The template contains the macros: 

`{$JITSI_COLIBRI_HOST}` - An IP/FQDN of Jitsi Videobridge. Default: `localhost` (in most cases there is no need to change this value)


`{$JITSI_MEET_HOST}` - FQDN or IP of Prosody XMPP Server. Default: `localhost` (you must change this value if your Prosody XMPP Server is hosted on a different server)

### Versions:

Tested and implemated on Zabbix 4.2.6.

Several people reported to me a problem with importing to 3><4.0 versions of zabbix. I can't reproduce the problem right now - you can try import an older version of this template (depending on UserParamFile, 1.0 Release), or if you have a time, find a solution and create pull request/give me a message.

If newest version of this template will not run on older zabbix's versions , please switch to 1.0/old branch to download UserParameter version.


### To Do:

* SDK callstats.io lib integration
